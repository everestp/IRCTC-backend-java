      ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   Use IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred IDE to run the main application file.

4. **Database Configuration**:
    - The project currently uses JSON or similar for user data storage.
    - Make sure any required database files are properly initialized or update the configuration if needed.

## Examples of Data

The following JSON object illustrates a sample dataset representing user management and ticket-booking functionalities:

```json
[
  {
    "username": "bug",
    "user_id": "f3ccde78-e7c7-481c-9b5b-b4bacf772d5d",
    "password": "fixed",
    "hashed_password": "$2a$10$EqL0uYQDqvTeINEJWp.fdOubTN/T9RDOBj1/zgAEUH1xLwyA4ppKS",
    "tickets_booked": []
  },
  {
    "username": "signupTesting",
    "user_id": "6c8c4ff6-477f-404c-9e97-b842c55a3131",
    "password": "testing",
    "hashed_password": "$2a$10$UrjL7jbCekl8ekvcpn8yke82pMmbDAPbn95/AR1GpDttONaUpGsky",
    "tickets_booked": []
  }
]
```

### Explanation:

- `username`: The user's chosen username.
- `user_id`: A unique identifier for the user.
- `password`: A plaintext password (used during signup or testing).
- `hashed_password`: The securely hashed version of the password (used for authentication).
- `tickets_booked`: A list of tickets associated with the user.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some suggested features or improvements:

1. **Secure Storage**: Replace JSON storage with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for scalability and better data integrity.
2. **Improved Security**:
    - Implement OAuth or JWT-based authentication.
    - Use environment variables for sensitive data.
3. **Frontend Integration**:
    - Build a user-facing interface to interact with backend services.
    - Use frameworks such as React/Vue.js for the UI.
4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
    - Add logging libraries like Log4j for better traceability.
    - Implement monitoring tools to track application performance.
